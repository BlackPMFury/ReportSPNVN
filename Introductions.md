# The Rules Before You Edit or Changes anything:
So You can Edit It, Is Always Allowed Edit that.
1. Dont Copying it Without my Permissions.
2. Do not Cover this plugin with one more reason.

# Introduce:
With The Gifl Part (Will have in Future) Add Point Or Anything with That, Find The CongDiem ($this->congDiem($ten, $diem);)
Remember: $diem as Point, You can Write to as 1,2 or 3 Everything you like. But You must add "+" to $diem.
